      <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio webpage! My name is Brad Prettyman and I am currently in the August cohort at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>. I was a college athlete, which I am very proud of my accomplishments during that time, and a college grad to back that up! I wanted to learn how to code because it's something that really interests me and seems like quite the challenge! So far, I really enjoy the problem solving side of coding. Very excited to learn more about coding!</p>
